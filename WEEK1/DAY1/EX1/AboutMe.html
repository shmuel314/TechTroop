    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        My name is <strong>Shmuel Harel</strong>, and I'm a <em>Full-Stack Developer</em>. I began my career in a
        completely different field—carpentry—but my curiosity and love for technology led me to transition into software
        development. I enjoy creating elegant, user-friendly web applications and constantly seek to improve my coding
        skills.

    <p>
        After completing a Full-Stack course, I joined a FinTech startup founded by my brother. There, I took a leading
        role in building Angular front-end features and integrating them with a NestJS backend. Working in a small team
        gave me a wide range of responsibilities, which helped me grow rapidly as a developer.

        I'm currently pursuing a <em>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science</em> at the Open University. Despite being
        busy with work and military reserve duty, I remain dedicated to my studies. I thrive on learning new things and
        am particularly interested in clean architecture, reactive programming, and improving accessibility in web
        applications.
